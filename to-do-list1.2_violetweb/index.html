Violet Web is a web development company that works closely with each client so our team can create exactly what the client is looking for to jazz up their personal or business-oriented website. Samantha has been studying web design and development for about two years now and through her process of learning, she has created numerous graphic and web projects such as a website for Duvolle Technology and the Lovely Luggage by Liz smartphone application.

             <h4>Haven Knight - Designer</h4>

             <img src="img/haven.jpg" alt="Picture of Haven"/>
               <p>Haven first learned her passion for design as she was growing up, playing games on the computer at a young age. When in high school she also attended a CareerTech for marketing and web design for 3 years. While there she learned the importance of visually pleasing the viewer and communicating the purpose of the site in a stylish manner. Ever since, visual design has been a passion for her. Over the years, she has created multiple web projects such as a professional smartphone application called “Prime Time Pottery.” Haven is not genuinely happy with her work unless she also pleases the person it is being created for so she considers it crucial to pay attention to detail when it comes to the client’s requests. That sensibility earned her a home working with the Violet Web Company.</p>
